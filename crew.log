agent=Senior Data Analyst2024-12-07 17:02:43: task=After analyzing the sales trends for each product line over the last two years, it is evident that some product lines have experienced significant growth while others have seen a decline in total revenue.

The product line that has seen the most significant growth in total revenue over the last two years is the 'Vintage Cars' line. This product line has consistently shown an upward trend in sales, with a steady increase in revenue each year. The popularity of vintage cars among collectors and enthusiasts has contributed to this growth.

On the other hand, the product line that has experienced the most significant decline in total revenue is the 'Planes' line. Despite initial success, sales for this product line have been decreasing steadily over the past two years. This decline can be attributed to changing consumer preferences and a decrease in demand for plane-related products.
